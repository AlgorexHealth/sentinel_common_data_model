Populated for all records. Several LOINC codes (LOINC) and/or local codes (LOCAL_CD) can point to one MS_Test_Name. | `ALP` |
| Result_Type | Char (1) | `N` = numeric<br>`C` = character | Indicates whether the laboratory test result is numeric (e.g., 100 ug/mL, <100 ug/mL, >100 ug/mL) and MS_Result_N will be populated, or character (e.g., for character results such as: +, POS, POSITIVE, and ranges, such as 50-100 mg/mL) and MS_Result_C will be populated, based on Data Partner's source data. | `N` |
| MS_Test_Sub_ Category | Char (6) | `BHCG` = beta human choriogonadotropin<br>`CLC` = calculated<br>`DDU` = d-dimer units<br>`DIRECT`= direct<br>`EIA` = enzyme immunoassay<br>`FEU` = fibrinogen equivalent units<br>`HCG` = human choriogonadotropin<br>`IF` = immunofluorescence<br>`NS` = not specified<br>`PCR` = probe and target amplification<br>`VTC` = organism-specific culture | Sub-category for MS_Test_Name. Sub-categories apply to only select laboratory tests. 'DIRECT' and 'CALCULATED' is only populated for MS_Test_Name = `CHOL_LDL`. 'DDU' and 'FEU' is only populated for MS_Test_Name = `D_DIMER`, Result_Type = `N`. 'BHCG' AND 'HCG' is only populated for `MS_Test_Name = PG`. | `PCR` |
| Fast_Ind | Char (1) | `F`= fasting<br>`R`= random<br>`X`= not applicable | Fasting Indicator. Not all laboratory tests are differentiated by fasting status. For laboratory tests where fasting status is not considered to interpret results, Fast_Ind is marked "X" (not applicable). For laboratory test results where fasting status may be considered to interpreting results (e.g., glucose), Fast_Ind is marked "F" (fasting) only if the source data included with the laboratory test result indicates fasting test. All other laboratory test results where fasting status may be considered that is not explicitly marked as fasting, Fast_Ind is marked "R" (random). | `F` |
| Specimen_Source | Char (6) | `BAL` = bronchoalveolar lavage<br/>`BALBX` = bronchoalveolar biopsy<br>`BLOOD` = blood<br>`CSF` = cerebrospinal fluid<br>`NPH` = nasopharyngeal swab<br>`NPWASH` = nasopharyngeal wash<br>`NSWAB` = nasal swab or nose specimen<br>`NWASH` = nasal wash<br>`OTHER` = other<br>`PLASMA` = plasma<br>`PPP` = platelet poor plasma<br>`SERUM` = serum<br>`SPUTUM` = sputum<br>`SR_PLS` = serum/plasma<br>`THRT` = throat swab, oropharyngeal swab<br>`UNK` = unknown or null<br>`URINE` = urine | Specimen source. Populated for all records. Some laboratory tests have several possible valid values for Specimen_Source. | `SERUM` |
| LOINC | Char (10) | LOINC code | Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) is a universal coding system for tests, measurements, and observations developed by the Regenstrief Institute. LOINC provides very granular information about the tests such as the long name of the test, test definition/description, component, system, property, timing, scale, method, and examples of units. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, are included. The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. If a record utilizes a local LOINC (e.g., LOINC candidate codes), the result of that record is included, however, the LOINC variable is set to null. Values in the LOINC variable do not contain leading zeros. LOINC is populated when available, thus not all records have LOINC. | `16182-8` |
| Stat | Char (1) | `E` = Expedite<br>`R` = Routine<br>`S` = Stat<br>`U` = Unknown or null | Immediacy of test. The intent of this variable is to determine whether the test was obtained as part of routine care or as an emergent/urgent diagnostic test (designated as Stat or Expedite). | `E` |
| Pt_Loc | Char (1) | `E` = Emergency department<br>`H` = Home<br>`I` = Inpatient<br>`O` = Outpatient<br>`U` = Unknown or null | Patient location where the lab specimen was obtained. | `O` |
| Result_Loc | Char (1) | `L` = Lab<br>`P` = Point of Care<br> | Location of the test result. Point of Care locations may include anticoagulation clinic, newborn nursery, finger stick in provider office, or home. The default value is 'L' unless the result is Point of Care. There are not any null values. | `L` |
| LOCAL_CD | Char (Site specific length) | Unique to each Data Partner | Local code (non-LOINC) related to an individual lab test. Values for LOCAL_CD are not required. LOCAL_CD is only populated if available in source data. This variable will not be used in queries, but may be used by local programmers to identify and extract the required CDM tests. | |
| BATTERY_CD | Char (Site specific length) | Unique to each Data Partner | Local code (non-LOINC) related to a battery or panel of lab tests. Values for BATTERY_CD are not required. BATTERY_CD is only populated if available in source data. This variable will not be used in queries, but may be used by local programmers to identify and extract the required CDM tests. | |
| PX | Char (Site specific length) | Procedure code | Procedure Code associated with the laboratory result record. Values for PX are not required. PX is only populated if available in source data. PX is populated if PX_CODETYPE is populated. | `76815` |
| PX_CodeType | Char (2) | `09` = ICD-9-CM<br>`10` = ICD-10-CM<br>`11` = ICD-11-CM<br>`C2` = CPT Category II<br>`C3` = CPT Category III<br>`C4` = CPT-4 (i.e., HCPCS Level I)<br>`H3` = HCPCS Level III<br>`HC` = HCPCS (i.e., HCPCS Level II)<br>`LO` = Local homegrown<br>`OT` = Other<br>`RE` = Revenue | Procedure code type associated with the laboratory result record. Values for PX_CODETYPE are not required. PX_CODETYPE is only populated if available in source data. PX_CODETYPE is populated if PX is populated. | `C4` |
| Order_dt3 | Numeric (4) | SAS date | Date that the test was ordered, represented as a SAS date value. SAS format is `MMDDYY10`. This date could fall anywhere from the same day the specimen was collected to months before the specimen was collected. Please see footnote 3. | `11/29/2009` |
| Lab_dt3 | Numeric (4) | SAS date | Date that the specimen was collected, represented as a SAS date value. SAS format is `MMDDYY10`. For most Sentinel activities, this is the most relevant date. Please see footnote 3. | `11/29/2009` |
| Lab_tm | Numeric (4) | SAS time | Time of day that the specimen was collected, represented as a SAS time value. SAS format is `HHMM`. Valid values are between 00:00 to 23:59. Please note that LAB_TM is associated with LAB_DT. | `18:00` |
| Result_dt3 | Numeric (4) | SAS date | Date that the laboratory test was resulted, represented as a SAS date value. SAS format is `MMDDYY10`. Dependent on the time of the test, this date could be the same day the specimen was collected or any date up to weeks later. Please see footnote 3. | `12/1/2009` |
| Result_tm | Numeric (4) | SAS time | Time that the laboratory test was resulted, represented as a SAS time value. SAS format is `HHMM`. Valid values are between 00:00 to 23:59. | `11:30` |
| Orig_Result | Char (50) | Text | Orig_Result is populated for all records. If Result_Type equals `N`, then the Orig_Result value represents the numeric portion of the test result, stripped of any modifiers (e.g., >, LE, GT) and/or result units (e.g., ng/ml, cells/mm3, %). If Result_Type equals "C", Orig_Result value reflects the test string based on source data. Additionally, for records where Result_Type = C, values may include a decimal point ('.'), a sign ('-', '+') or text (e.g., 'POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE', 'DETECTED'). For records where Result_Type = `N`, the symbols `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` are removed from the value and stored in the Modifier variable and result units are removed and stored as Orig_Result_Unit variable. | `+` |
| MS_Result_C | Char (50) | `BORDERLINE`<br>`NEGATIVE`<br>`POSITIVE`<br>`UNDETERMINED`<br>`RANGE: start|end[unit]` | This standardized result value is only populated for text or character results (Result_Type = C) and is null for numeric results (Result_Type = N). If Result_Type = "C" and the source result is a range (e.g., 50-100 mg/mL), then populate MS_Result_C using Orig_Result with the start and end values of the range delimited by a vertical bar (e.g., "50-100 mg/mL" becomes "50\|100 mg/mL"). | `POSITIVE`<br/>`50|100 mg/mL` |
| MS_Result_N | Numeric (8) | Numeric digits with or without<br/>a decimal | Standardized/converted numeric result for records where Result_Type=N. Acceptable values are numeric digits with or without a decimal ("."). If the standardized result unit (STD_RESULT_UNIT) differs from an acceptable MS_RESULT_UNIT for a numeric test (RESULT_TYPE=N), then ORIG_RESULT is converted prior to populating the MS_RESULT_N value. Additionally, MS_RESULT_UNIT reflects this conversion. This variable is only populated for numeric results (RESULT_TYPE = N) and does not contain negative values. This variable is null for text/character results (RESULT_TYPE = C). | `100` |
| Modifier | Char (2) | `EQ` = equal<br>`GE` = greater than or equal to<br>`GT` = greater than<br>`LE` = less than or equal to<br>`LT` = less than<br>`TX` = text | Modifier for result values. Any relational operators in the original source data value (e.g., <, >, or =) are reflected in the Modifier variable. For example, if the original source data value is "<=200", then Orig_Result = 200 and Modifier = 'LE'. If the original source data result value is text, then Modifier = TX. If the original source data result value is numeric (digits with or without decimal) and does not contain an operator, then Modifier = EQ. | `LE` |
| Orig_Result_unit | Char (20) | Text | Original units for the test result, as reported in source data. This variable is directly related to ORIG_RESULT and MODIFIER. This variable does not include the test name, or any special characters, unless that character is part of the unit value. For example, special characters are included in "10^9/L". However, special characters are not included in "^U/L^", as these carats are not part of the unit value. Some laboratory tests may not have a result unit. | `10^9/L` |
| Std_Result_unit | Char (11) | Text | Standardized units for the result. The purpose of STD_RESULT_UNIT is to modify ORIG_RESULT_UNIT from free text to a standardized unit, as an intermediary step in converting from ORIG_RESULT_UNIT to MS_RESULT_UNIT. This variable is only populated for records where Result_type = N. Common rules and guidelines for populating STD_RESULT_UNIT, include: converting all text values for ORIG_RESULT_UNIT to uppercase, and using standard abbreviations as provided by SOC. This variable does not include special characters, unless that character is part of the unit. For example, special characters are included in "10^9/L". However, special characters are not included in "^U/L^", as these carats are not part of the unit value. This value is not usually null, though there are exceptions, such as when the test result is a ratio (e.g., International Normalized Ratio \[INR\]). This value is null for character tests (Result_Type=C) until that test has been reviewed and characterized by the Clinical Data Elements Workgroup. | `CELL/MM3` |
| MS_Result_unit | Char (11) | Text | Converted/standardized result units for the value populated in `MS_RESULT_N`. This value is null for records where Result_Type = C, and null for Laboratory Tests that have not been characterized and reviewed by the Clinical Data Elements Workgroup. This value may be null for some numeric tests (e.g., as International Normalized Ratio \[INR\] is a ratio, it does not have a result unit). For tests that require a result unit, MS_RESULT_UNIT is set to "UNKNOWN" for all records where the original result unit is missing or blank, "NULL", "N/A", "NA", or "UNK." Guidance is provided for only Laboratory Tests that have been reviewed by the Clinical Data Elements Workgroup. | `G/L` |
| `NORM_RANGE_LOW` | Char (8) | Text | Lower bound of the normal reference range, as assigned by the laboratory. The normal range associated with a test, as assigned by the laboratory is parsed out into the following variables: `NORM_RANGE_LOW`, `MODIFIER_LOW`, `NORM_RANGE_HIGH`, `MODIFIER_HIGH`, and reflects what is seen in source data. Value only contains the value of the lower bound of the normal reference range. This value is not converted and unit of measure is not included. It is assumed that the associated unit is the same as the original result unit from the source data. The symbols >, <, >=, <= are removed. For example, if the normal range for a test is >100 and <300, then "100" is entered. Additionally, this value is null for records where Result_Type = C. | `100` |
| `MODIFIER_LOW` | Char (2) | `EQ` = equal<br>`GE` = greater than or equal to<br>`GT` = greater than | Modifier for `NORM_RANGE_LOW` values. The normal range associated with a test, as assigned by the laboratory is parsed out into the following variables: `NORM_RANGE_LOW`, `MODIFIER_LOW`, `NORM_RANGE_HIGH`, `MODIFIER_HIGH` and reflects what is seen in source data. This value is null for records where Result_Type=C. For numeric results one of the following needs to be true: <ol><li>Both `MODIFIER_LOW` and `MODIFIER_HIGH` contain EQ (e.g., normal values fall in the range 3-10).</li><li>`MODIFIER_LOW` contains GT or GE and `MODIFIER_HIGH` is null (e.g., normal values are >3 with no upper boundary).</li><li>`MODIFIER_HIGH` contains LT or LE and `MODIFIER_LOW` is null (e.g., normal values are <=10 with no lower boundary).</li></ol> | `EQ` |
| `NORM_RANGE_HIGH` | Char (8) | Text | Upper bound of the normal reference range, as assigned by the laboratory. The normal range associated with a test, as assigned by the laboratory is parsed out into the following variables: `NORM_RANGE_LOW`, `MODIFIER_LOW`, `NORM_RANGE_HIGH`, `MODIFIER_HIGH` and reflects what is seen in source data. Value only contains the value of the upper bound of the normal reference range. This value is not converted and unit of measure is not included. It is assumed that the associated unit is the same as the original result unit from source data. The symbols >, <, >=, <= are removed. For example, if the normal range for a test is >100 and <300, then "100" is entered. Additionally, this value is null for records where Result_Type = C. | `300` |
| `MODIFIER_HIGH` | Char (2) | `EQ` = equal<br>`LE` = less than or equal to<br>`LT` = less than | Modifier for `NORM_RANGE_HIGH` values. The normal range associated with a test, as assigned by the laboratory is parsed out into the following variables: ``NORM_RANGE_LOW``, ``MODIFIER_LOW``, ``NORM_RANGE_HIGH``, ``MODIFIER_HIGH`` and reflects what is seen in source data. The value is null for records where Result_Type=C. For numeric results one of the following needs to be true: <ol><li>Both `MODIFIER_LOW` and `MODIFIER_HIGH` contain EQ (e.g., normal values fall in the range 3-10).</li><li>`MODIFIER_LOW` contains GT or GE and `MODIFIER_HIGH` is null (e.g., normal values are >3 with no upper boundary).</li><li>`MODIFIER_HIGH` contains LT or LE and `MODIFIER_LOW` is null (e.g., normal values are <=10 with no lower boundary).</li></ol> | `LT` |
| Abn_ind | Char (2) | `AB` = abnormal<br>`AH` = abnormally high<br>`AL` = abnormally low<br>`CH` = critically high<br>`CL` = critically low<br>`CR` = critical<br>`IN` = inconclusive<br>`NL` = normal<br>`UN` = unknown | Abnormal result indicator. This value comes directly from the source data; this value is not created programmatically based on variables such as `MS_RESULT_N`, ``NORM_RANGE_HIGH``, or `NORM_RANGE_LOW`. | `CR` |
| Order_dept | Char (Site Specific length) | Unique to each Data Partner | Local code for ordering provider department. Values for ORDER_DEPT are not required. Populate only if ordering provider department is available in source data. | |
| Facility_Code | Char (Site Specific length) | Servicing provider identifier | Local facility code that identifies the hospital or clinic. Taken from facility claims. Values for FACILITY_CODE are not required. Populate only if facility code is available in source data. This information is useful when locating medical charts for review. | `FC12345678` |

## NOTES:

1. Only records with actual lab results should be included in this table. If the result suggests that the test was run (e.g., result is "borderline" or "inconclusive") include it. But if the test is not resulted for any reason (specimen not sufficient, patient did not show) then do not include it. Additionally, negative numeric values (e.g., -5.0 mg/ml) are not included.
2. PatID is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source Data Partner. For analytical data sets requiring patient-level data, only the pseudoidentifier is used to link across all information belonging to a patient.
3. There are three dates that can be associated to the laboratory results: Order date (`ORDER_DT`), Laboratory date (`LAB_DT`), and Result date (`RESULT_DT`). The typical sequence of these date variables, from earliest to latest occurrence, is: ORDER_DT ≤ LAB_DT ≤ RESULT_DT. One or more of these dates is populated for each record in the Laboratory Result Table. These dates are all populated if available in source data.
