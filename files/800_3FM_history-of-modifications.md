|v5.0|07/31/15|Updated Laboratory Result Table as follows. Added a new variable `Fast_Ind`, to indicate whether the test was performed under fasting conditions. Added a new variable `Result_Type` to indicate whether lab result is expected to be numeric or character. Removed “QN” and “QL” from allowable `MS_Test_Name` values. New tests (and preliminary guidance) added: CHOL_HDL = cholesterol high density lipoprotein, CHOL_LDL = cholesterol low density lipoprotein, CHOL_TOT = cholesterol total, SODIUM= sodium, TRIG = triglycerides, TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone.

Corrected typos and examples. Created Sentinel Common Data Model Laboratory Result Table Documentation (v1.0) for comprehensive  guidance to populate the Laboratory Result Table.|SOC|
|V5.0.1|02/02/16|Minor text modifications.|SOC|
|V6.0|09/13/16|Added new tables: Inpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient Transfusion. Added `Padmit` variable to the Diagnosis table (variable only populated by one Data Partner). Minor text modifications.|SOC|

Removed State Vaccine Table tab. The State Vaccine Table is not regularly maintained and updated so is not a part of the SCDM itself. Removed Summary Table (ST) tabs. Summary Tables are derived from SCDM tables and are not considered to be part of the SCDM itself. Modified several examples that were inconsistent with the variable description. Other minor text and formatting modifications.|SOC|
