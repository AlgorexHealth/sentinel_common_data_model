# List of Tables

| Table Name | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
|1. [Enrollment](file0010_admin_enrollment.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Enrollment Table has a start/stop structure that contains one record per continuous enrollment period. Members with medical coverage, drug coverage, or both should be included. A unique combination of `PatID`, `Enr_Start`, `Enr_End`, `MedCov`, `DrugCov`, and `Chart` identifies a unique record. A break in enrollment (of at least one day) or a change in either the medical or drug coverage variables should generate a new record. |
|2. [Demographic](file0011_admin_demographic.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Demographic Table contains one record per `PatID` with the most recent information on `Birth_Date`, `Sex`, `Race/Ethnicity`, and `Zip Code`. |
|3. [Dispensing](file0012_admin_dispensing.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Outpatient Pharmacy Dispensing Table contains one record per unique combination of `PatID`, `NDC`, and `RxDate`. Each record represents an outpatient pharmacy dispensing. Rollback transactions and other adjustments should be processed before populating this table. |
|4.1. [Encounter](file0013_admin_encounter.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Encounter Table contains one record per `PatID` and `EncounterID`. Each encounter should have a single record in the SCDM Encounter Table. Each diagnosis and procedure recorded during the encounter should have a separate record in the Diagnosis or Procedure Tables. Multiple visits to the same provider on the same day should be considered one encounter and should include all diagnoses and procedures that were recorded during those visits. Visits to different providers on the same day, such as a physician appointment that leads to a hospitalization, should be considered multiple encounters. Rollback transactions and other adjustments should be processed before populating this table. |
|4.2. [Diagnosis](file0014_admin_diagnosis.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Diagnosis Table contains one record per unique combination of `PatID`, `EncounterID`, `DX`, and `DX_CodeType`. This table should capture all uniquely recorded diagnoses for all encounters. |
|4.3. [Procedure](file0015_admin_procedure.md) | Created by Data Partners using Data Partner data. | The SCDM Procedure Table contains one record per unique combination of `PatID`, `EncounterID`, `PX`, and `PX_CodeType`. This table should capture all uniquely recorded procedures for all encounters. |
|5.1. [Death](file0210_registry_death.md) | Created by selected Data Partners. | The SCDM Death Table contains one record per `PatID`. When legacy data have conflicting reports, please make a local determination as to which to use. There is typically a 1-2 year lag in death registry data. |

Only include resulted lab tests. Data Partners are strongly encouraged to review the comprehensive Sentinel Common Data Model Laboratory Result Table Documentation for details on how to populate each variable. |
|6.2. [Vital Signs](file0111_clinical_vital_signs.md) | Created by selected Data Partners. | The SCDM Vital Signs Table contains one record per result/entry. |
|7. [Inpatient Pharmacy](file0310_inpatient_inpatient_pharmacy.md) | Created by selected Data Partners. | The SCDM Inpatient Pharmacy table contains data on inpatient drug administrations. It contains one record per unique combination of `PatID`, `NDC`, `RxADate`, `RxATime`, and `RxID`. Each record represents a unique inpatient pharmacy dispensing administration. |

This table is created following identification of mothers (via evidence of live delivery by women aged 10-54 inclusive) and infants (via date of birth) in the Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD). The file may include: <ol><li> Live birth deliveries (with `MPatID` and `ADate`) that were linked to a child (`CPatID`);</li><li>Live birth deliveries (with `MPatID`and `ADate`) that were not linked to a child (`CPatID`, `CBirth_Date`, `Sex`, and `CEnr_Start` will have missing values); and</li><li>Children (with `CPatID`) who were not linked to a mother (`MPatID`, `MBirth_Date`, `Age`, `EncounterID`, `EncType`, `ADate`, `DDate`, `Birth_Type`, and `Birth_Type_Primes` will have missing values).</li></ol> |
