# SCDM: Mother-Infant Linkage Table Structure

**Description:** The SCDM Mother-Infant Linkage Table contains one record per `MPatID`, `CPatID`, and `ADate`. This table is created following identification of mothers (via evidence of live delivery by women aged 10-54 inclusive) and infants (via date of birth) in the Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD). The file may include:

1. Live birth deliveries (with `MPatID` and `ADate`) that were linked to an infant (`CPatID`);
2. Live birth deliveries (with `MPatID` and `ADate`) that were not linked to an infant (`CPatID`, `CBirth_Date`, `Sex`, and `CEnr_Start` will have missing values); and
3. Infants (with `CPatID`) who were not linked to a mother (`MPatID`, `MBirth_Date`, `Age`, `EncounterID`, `EncType`, `ADate`, `DDate`, `Birth_Type`, and `Birth_Type_Primes` will have missing values).

**Sort Order:** The Mother-Infant Linkage Table should be sorted by `MPatID`, `Adate`, and `CPatID`.

**Unique Row:** `MPatID`, `EncounterID`, `CPatID`.

| `CPatID` | Num(#) | Unique member identifier. | Required for infant | Arbitrary person-level identifier. Used to link across tables. Use the fewest number of bytes necessary to hold all distinct values; see ["SAS Lengths" Reference Table](SCDM_draft_reference_tables_8.1.0_r2.xlsx).

| `CEnr_Start` | Num(4) | SAS Date | Required for infant | Earliest `Enr_Start` from Enrollment table. Missing for mother/delivery-only records. | `1/1/2005` |

Missing for infant-only records. | `3` |
| `Birth_Type_Primes` | Num(8) | 2+ | Required for mother | Multiplication of all prime numbers assigned to all instances of `Birth_Type` found in delivery codes within the selected encounter, as follows:<br> Prime = Birth_Type<br> `2` = `Birth_Type` of 0<br> `3` = `Birth_Type` of 1<br> `5` = `Birth_Type` of 2 <br>`7` = `Birth_Type` of 3 <br> `11` = `Birth_Type` of 4 <br>`13` = `Birth_Type` of 5 <br>`17` = `Birth_Type` of 8<br> This provides a record of all values of `Birth_Type` for the selected encounter.  Missing for infant-only records. | `5` |

## NOTES:

1. `PatID` is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source Data Partner. For analytical data sets requiring patient-level data, only the pseudoidentifier is used to link across all information belonging to a patient.

2. The Encounter, Diagnosis, Procedure, Inpatient Transfusion, Inpatient Pharmacy, Vital Signs, Mother-Infant Linkage, Inpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient Transfusion, and Prescribing tables are linked by `PatID` and `EncounterID`.

3. If more than 1 delivery encounter occur on the same `ADate`, then the `EncType` values are based on the encounter selected from the following hierarchy: `IP` > `ED` > `AV` > `IS` > `OA`.
