# Overview and Description of the Common Data Model v7.1.0

## Sentinel

The primary goal of Sentinel is to build and operate a national public health surveillance system to monitor the safety of FDA-regulated medical products, including drugs, biologics, and devices. Sentinel is part of the Sentinel Initiative, the FDA's response to a congressional mandate to create an active surveillance system using electronic health data.

The Sentinel program will undertake three major types of activities: (1) prospective evaluation of accumulating experience about specific medical products and specific suspected safety problems; (2) evaluation of the impact of FDA actions (e.g., labeling changes) on medical practice and health outcomes; and (3) rapid assessment of past experience in response to FDA questions about specific exposures and outcomes.

Sentinel Collaborating Institutions maintain data resources and provide technical, scientific, and methodological expertise as needed to meet the public health surveillance requirements of Sentinel. The Collaborating Institutions also participate as members of the Planning Board, the Safety Science Committee, the Sentinel Operations Center (SOC), and various Sentinel workgroups.

## Sentinel Common Data Model

The SOC coordinates the network of Sentinel Data Partners and leads development of the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM), a standard data structure that allows Data Partners to quickly execute distributed programs against local data. The SOC manages creation of the Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD) using the SCDM, and maintains complete documentation of the implementation and characteristics of the SDD. The SCDM was developed in accordance with the Mini-Sentinel Common Data Model Guiding Principles and was modeled after the Health Care Systems Research Network (formerly known as HMO Research Network) Virtual Data Warehouse.

The SCDM currently includes 13 tables that represent information for the data elements needed for Sentinel activities. Records are linked across tables by a unique person identifier, PatID. Details of the 13 tables are provided in this document.

This data model is freely available to all.
