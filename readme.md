# Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM) Version 7.1.0.

## Overview

This repository contains documentation (data dictionary) for the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM) Version 7.1.0., which is the standard data structure necessary for executing Sentinel's routine querying tools. Note that data must be in the form of SAS datasets in order to use these analytic programs.

SCDM Version 7.1.0. includes 13 tables that represent information for the data elements needed for Sentinel activities. Records are linked across tables by a unique person identifier, PatID. Details of the 13 tables are provided in this repository.

## What is the SCDM?

The SCDM was developed by the Sentinel Operations Center (SOC) in accordance with the [Mini-Sentinel Common Data Model Guiding Principles](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/sites/default/files/data/distributed-database/Mini-Sentinel_CommonDataModel_GuidingPrinciples_v1.0_0.pdf) and was originally modeled after the [Health Care Systems Research Network Virtual Data Warehouse (HCSRN/VDW)](http://www.hcsrn.org/en/Tools%20&%20Materials/VDW/). 

## How to Access SCDM 7.1.0.

To translate data into the SCDM, navigate to the SCDM branch in this repository by using the drop down menu in the upper left-hand corner or click [this link](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/QA/repos/sentinel_common_data_model/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fscdm) to access the documentation.


## How to Access Other SCDM Versions

SCDM Version 7.1.0. will be followed by Version 8.0.0. and 8.1.0. in 2021. To access these versions, navigate to the SCDM branch in this repository by using the drop down menu in the upper left-hand corner or click [this link](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/QA/repos/sentinel_common_data_model/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fscdm) to access the documentation.

For an example dataset formatted to suit SCDM 7.0.0, please visit the Sentinel website to download [Medicare Claims Synthetic Public Use Files in Sentinel Common Data Model Format](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/sentinel/surveillance-tools/software-toolkits/Medicare-SynPUFs-in-SCDM) files.


## Getting Started

Follow the guidelines above for creating a SCDM/translating your data into SCDM.
