# Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM)  

#### Overview  
The Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM) represents the standard data structure that allows for rapid implementation of standard queries across the Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD). [<b>Sentinel routine querying tools</b>](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/AD/repos/qrp/browse) are designed to run against data transformed into the Sentinel Common Data Model format.

Sentinel routine querying tools are SASÂ® programs. This means the SCDM-formatted data must be in the form of SAS datasets in order to use these analytic programs.


#### What is the SCDM?
The SCDM was developed by the Sentinel Operations Center (SOC) in accordance with the [<b>Mini-Sentinel Common Data Model Guiding Principles</b>](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/sites/default/files/data/distributed-database/Mini-Sentinel_CommonDataModel_GuidingPrinciples_v1.0_0.pdf) and was originally modeled after the [<b>Health Care Systems Research Network Virtual Data Warehouse (HCSRN/VDW)</b>](http://www.hcsrn.org/en/Tools%20&%20Materials/VDW/). 

The SCDM includes various tables of data elements. Records are linked across tables by a unique person identifier, PatID. 


#### The following versions of the SCDM are available:<br>

[<b>SCDM Version 7.1.0</b>](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/SCDM/repos/sentinel_common_data_model/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2FDEV-11439)<br>
Date: 7/18/20<br>
Updated Laboratory Result Table as follows:<br> 
* Added new allowable values to several existing variables in order to include new Covid-19 diagnostic test results.<br> 
* New `MS_Test_Name` value of SARS_COV_2 added.<br>  
* New `MS_Test_Sub_Category` value of IA_RAP = immunoassay, rapid and SEQ=sequencing added.<br> 
* `New Specimen_Source` value of SALIVA=saliva added.<br>


#### How to Access the SCDM 
To translate data into the SCDM, navigate to the SCDM branch in this repository by using the drop down menu in the upper left-hand corner or click [<b>this link</b>](https://dev.sentinelsystem.org/projects/QA/repos/sentinel_common_data_model/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fscdm) to access the documentation.   

For an example dataset in the SCDM format, please visit the Sentinel website to download [<b>Medicare Claims Synthetic Public Use Files in Sentinel Common Data Model Format</b>](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/sentinel/surveillance-tools/software-toolkits/Medicare-SynPUFs-in-SCDM) files.


#### Getting Started
Follow the guidelines above for creating a SCDM/translating your data into SCDM.  


#### Additional Information
The Sentinel Operations Center has limited capacity to support use of our tools. However, we welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions pertaining to our documentation or tools. Email us [<b>here</b>](mailto:info@sentinelsystem.org?subject=Git).
